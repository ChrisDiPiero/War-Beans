  <section class="section-wrapper">
    <p>War is a classic card game of strategy and... okay, no, not really. It's just 
      pure, dumb luck.
    </p>
    <p>The object is to take as many of the cards in the deck that
       you can. A standard deck of cards is shuffled and dealt out to two or more 
       players. Each player flips the top card of their pile at the same time. Whoever
      has the highest card takes all of the cards played that round. Of course, jacks 
      beat 10s, queens beat jacks, Kings beat queens, and aces beat all!
    </p> 
    <p>
      In the case of a tie, the players leave the flipped cards in the kitty and flip one more each. The winner
      then takes all the cards in the kitty, unless there's a tie! Rinse, repeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game is played until all of the cards have been taken.

  <h2 class="h2">House Rules</h2>
  <section class="section-wrapper">
    <p>
      There are often variations, or "house rules", when playing a game like this.
      One such variation is where on a tie, three more cards are placed in the kitty, 
      face down, by each player, then one more is flipped over. The winner then takes all the cards.
      Another is the rule where an ace is beaten by a two.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had originally planned on adding options to accommodate these house rules, but
      ran out of time. I hope to get the opportunity to do so, but most of the work
      went into styling and animation.

      All vanilla. The animations are mostly CSS. I had to place some of the elements
      statically so I used CSS variables that I changed with media queries. I could
      probably make it even drier using CSS calc functionality given the time.
