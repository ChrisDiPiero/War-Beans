# War Card Game

This is a game I put together for a Mintbean hack-a-thon. The object was to build a card game. This is my entry for a front-end only deployment. It is made with vanilla JavaScript and HTML with a bit of CSS animation.

I built the app mobile first, using CSS variables to make resizing for a larger screen size much easier.

I also tried to keep as much of the logic as functional as possible since my next step will be to code a go-fish game with the same interface and re-using as much of the code as possible.

The card faces are a grid in a single SVG that I made in Illustrator. The card face and value data pulled from the player decks is used to calculate the object position of the SVG (ala sprite sheet animation).

## Tech Used:

All vanilla CSS and JavaScript.

I got help getting started with building the deck of cards from the video:

The deck shuffling I got from here:

The "nuke" svg came from:
